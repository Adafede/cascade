This vignette describes the very basic steps of **CASCADE**.

## Pre-requisites

- A file containing DDA MS data with additional signals (PDA, ELSD, CAD)
- A file containing features, as obtained by [mzmine](https://mzio.io)
- A file containing annotations, as obtained by [TIMA](https://taxonomicallyinformedannotation.github.io/tima)

All coming steps admit you already installed `cascade`:

```{r eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
install.packages(
  "cascade",
  repos = c(
    "https://adafede.r-universe.dev",
    "https://bioc.r-universe.dev",
    "https://cloud.r-project.org"
  )
)
```

## More details

More details are available in the related [vignettes](https://adafede.github.io/cascade/articles).

## A note about parallelization

This package uses `{future}`.
If you think you could benefit from parallelization, have a look at <https://future.futureverse.org/reference/plan.html> to see how to set it up.
